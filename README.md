# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website created using **HTML5** and **basic CSS3**. The website consists of two main pages: a Home page and a Contact page.

The project demonstrates my understanding of fundamental web development concepts such as semantic HTML structure, CSS styling, layout design, and basic page navigation.
