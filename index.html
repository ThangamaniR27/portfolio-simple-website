    <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
<p class="section-two__desc">
    I am a graduate in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) with a strong interest in transitioning into the IT field. I am currently building my career as a front-end web developer, focusing on creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly web pages.I have hands-on knowledge of HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, and I am continuously improving my technical skills through practice and self-learning. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to real-world projects.
    In addition to my technical skills, I am an English typist with good attention to detail, which helps me in documentation, content formatting, and communication. I am motivated, disciplined, and eager to grow in an IT environment where I can learn, contribute, and develop professionally.
    My goal is to secure an entry-level IT or web development role where I can enhance my skills and build a strong foundation in the software industry.
